## common/api

### Overview

Helper hooks, context and utilities for communicating with APIs

### Intention

The intention is not to have specific requests defined here. It would generally be more suitable for specific requests for data to be collocated with where that data is used - this is a collocation of utilities for communicating with API's.

### Tips & Things to think about

- Try to lean heavily on the use of react-query - most of the use cases for communicating with APIs are covered within the package.

### Future considerations
