## common/ui/components/domain

### Overview

This is a collection of components which are very specific to omSupply-client and are purpose designed and built. They don't really fit in a category.

### Intentions

The intention is that this module is a place for components which can't be categorised under the name of a traditional UI widget/component like a 'drop down' or 'accordion'. However, they are generic enough and will be utilised in multiple different packages.

### Tips & Things to keep in mind

- Traditional UI components have the benefit of being understandable by users as they've seen and used them before. If you land here because what your building doesn't fit anywhere - make sure you've considered all the more traditional options

### Future considerations
